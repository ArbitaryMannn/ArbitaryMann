    😄 <strong>Dev Note:</strong> Strong preference for <strong>C-style and JavaScript-based languages</strong> —

  I am building with the opportunities currently in my hands and nothing more.
  <strong>Pelikan WAA</strong> operates as a fully independent, self-funded initiative,
  delivering real services to real companies in Azerbaijan.
  My objectives are not theoretical — <strong>they are operational, measurable, and inevitable</strong>.
  I leave this note here as a long-term record of that commitment.
