<h1>Ali Yabuz (ArbitaryMann)</h1>

<p>
  Security researcher and software developer with a strong focus on <strong>macOS internals, local privilege escalation,
  authorization mechanisms, and low-level system behavior analysis</strong>. I operate at the intersection of
  <em>offensive security research</em>, <em>game security engineering</em>, and <em>secure backend systems</em>,
  with a strong emphasis on real-world exploitation, protocol abuse, and automation-driven attack surfaces.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    🔬 <strong>Research Focus:</strong><br>
    - macOS authorization services, local privilege escalation chains, and sandbox escape techniques<br>
    - <strong>Game security research:</strong> Growtopia private server ecosystems, packet manipulation, item duplication vectors, economy abuse, anti-cheat bypass concepts, and client-side memory analysis<br>
    - <strong>FPS multiplayer security:</strong> CS:GO matchmaking abuse models, trust factor manipulation theory, game server exploit surfaces, and cheat detection evasion logic <br>
    - <strong>Cryptocurrency systems:</strong> Token contract logic flaws, rug-pull pattern analysis, wallet authorization abuse, phishing automation, and on-chain/off-chain interaction vulnerabilities<br>
    - <strong>NLP & AI security:</strong> Prompt injection, chatbot manipulation, data poisoning risks, LLM automation abuse, and conversation-based social engineering pipelines
  </li>

<p>
  My work is driven by <strong>controlled experimentation, adversarial thinking, and secure-by-design principles</strong>.
  I prioritize reproducibility, precision, and ethical responsibility in all applied security research and system development.
